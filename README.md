# Tinyrenderer in Rust for fun :)

Was starting to feel a bit of burn out and whenever I do, I tend to look
back to my roots of what made me fall in love with coding to begin with:

* Graphics programming
* Game Development
* Operating Systems

So this will be a fun distractor for me on weekends. Feel free to fork, follow
along, or provide feedback if you like.


Thanks!
